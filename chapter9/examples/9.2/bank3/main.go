/*
Each time a goroutine accesses the variables of the bank (just balance here), it must call the
mutexâ€™s Lock method to acquire an exclusive lock. If some other goroutine has acquired the
lock, this operation will block until the other goroutine calls Unlock and the lock becomes
available again. The mutex guards the shared variables.
